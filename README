Welcome to the game of mooninites. This is like a space invader game.
Very simple, kill the oncoming cops, and earn points for a high 
score. Each raid gets progressively harder, until level 40.  Good 
luck in getting there. If you fail to shoot all the cops, then 
you'll lose a joint.

INPUT
    Move - arrow keys
    Fire - space bar
    Quad Laser - b
    Quit - q

SCORING
    Points are awarded on kills, unused quad lasers, how quickly 
    you get through a raid, and the highest level attained. No 
    points are given using a quad laser.

QUAD LASER
    The ultimate laser weapon. Only use this when in a pinch. It 
    will destroy all cops on the playing.

BONUSES
    Every 5 levels you'll recieve an extra joint. Every 10 levels 
    you'll recieve an extra quad laser.
